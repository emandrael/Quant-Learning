  - The main difference is global variables can be accessed from any function.
  - Local variables can only be accesessed from within the scope of the function.
+ Can a local variable be declared anywhere within a block?
  - Yes it can be. As long as it's declared before it's used.
+ Does a local variable hold it's value between calls to the function in which it is declared.
  - No local variables are removed once the function that used them is done.\
